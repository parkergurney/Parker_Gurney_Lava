# Inventory Dashboard (Next.js Project)

I deployed the website using vercel - https://parker-gurney-lava.vercel.app/

I connected the frontend to a PostgreSQL using Prisma as the ORM. I used Next.js' API routes to put, patch, and fetch the database.

To support images, I integrated blob storage, so when someone adds a product they can upload a picture along with it.

On the frontend, I built features for searching, filtering, and sorting products:

The UI is built in React with Tailwind CSS and is responsive.
